# Vehicle_Tracker_and_Counter
This project uses YOLOv11n and custom tracking to detect, track, and count vehicles in videos. It supports multi-line counting, duplicate count prevention, frame skipping to speed up processing, and an interactive ROI selection to focus on relevant areas. A pre-processing step detects traffic flow to optimize line placement for each video.
